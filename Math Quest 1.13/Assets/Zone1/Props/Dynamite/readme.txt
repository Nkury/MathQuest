The meshes to not have colliders attached, to add a collider, select the desired mesh, then go to 'Component, Physics, and select the desired collider type.
To make the dynamite move around when a force is applied (physics), ensure the mesh has a collider, then in the same physics menu select rigid body.
In the inspector view of mesh, you can change the values you want.

save the selected mesh as a seprate max file to export, or simply 'export Selected'.
