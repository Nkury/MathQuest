# MathQuest
An educational Final Fantasy-esque role-playing game where first, second, and third graders can explore a fantasy medieval setting and vanquish monsters through basic arithmetic math battles. My role on the four-person, one-month long project was to design the world layout, battle system, and battle animations in the Unity3D game engine using C# scripts. The main concept for the battle system was that the player would select two actions that power levels added up to the health of the enemy. An over-calculation would result in a "miss" while an under-calculation led to the enemy attacking the player. 

For insight into my battle system code, click <a href="https://github.com/Nkury/MathQuest/tree/master/Math%20Quest%201.13/Assets/Battle%20System">HERE</a>. The battle system consists of the following scripts:

        BattleSystem.cs (generic battle system)
        Final Boss Battle/FinalBossBattleSystem.cs (unique battle system for final boss)
        FadeOut.cs (for fading out when player dies)

I also dealth with persistence of data between scenes (shown through code in the BattleSystem.cs) as well as the design flow for the tutorial level.
